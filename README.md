Hello, my username is Fun Fact, I play osu! and I am interested in programming.
*My Roadmap of learning programming*
1. I took some basic courses to learn the syntax of C++/Java (2 weeks more or less)
2. Learning deeper concepts about object oriented programming such as inheritance, polymorphism, etc (started October 4th, 2025)
